 - Clicking on any card image will show details on that specific pokemon.

Pokedex also allows you to __filter visible pokemons by type__:
 * Click type tag under pokemon name to activate filter.
 * Clicking on any tag type again, will add that type to filter options.
 * Click "Reset filter" button to reset filter. [Thanks cap!]
